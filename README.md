# covid-19_Biomarkers
The mNGS dataset belonging to open-access COVID-19 positive and negative patients was utilized for the analyses. A cohort study for COVID-19 was undertaken at the Uni-versity of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, and the dataset was obtained from that study. In the dataset, there are 15,979 genes of 234 patients with COVID-19 negative 141 (60.3%)  and COVID-19 positive 93 (39.7%)
